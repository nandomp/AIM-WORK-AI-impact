# AIM-WORK project: Analysis on Impacts of Algorithmic Management and Artificial Intelligence in
the Workplace
## AI impact chapter
 
The AIM-WORK project explores the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) innovations on workplace activities and the wider professional environment. As part of this initiative, we have compiled a detailed catalogue of AI benchmarks that are essential for measuring and comparing the capabilities of different AI models. This dataset, derived from the Papers-with-Code platform, categorises benchmarks by data modality (e.g. text, image, audio, video) and includes key metrics that reflect research activity and interest.



## Dataset Description

This dataset provides a comprehensive list of AI benchmarks categorized by data modality. Below is a description of the columns included in the dataset:

- **Modality**: Indicates the type of data processed by the AI benchmark (e.g., Images, Texts, Audio).
- **Total_benc**: The total number of benchmarks available for the specified data modality.
- **Name**: The commonly used name of the benchmark dataset.
- **FullName**: The full name or expanded name of the benchmark dataset.
- **Description**: A brief description of the benchmark (if available).
- **NumPapers**: The number of research papers that reference or use this benchmark dataset.
- **NumBench**: The number of tasks or leaderboards associated with this benchmark dataset.
- **URL**: A link to the benchmark's page on the Papers-with-Code platform.

Note: Some entries might have "NA" where specific information is not available.
